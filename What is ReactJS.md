ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance, ensuring that only parts of the UI that have changed are re-rendered. It's widely used for creating dynamic, interactive web applications and is maintained by Facebook.
