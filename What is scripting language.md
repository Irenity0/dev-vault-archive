~~A **scripting language** is a type of programming language that is designed for automating tasks or controlling the behavior of software applications. Unlike compiled languages, **scripting languages** are often interpreted line-by-line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code ahead of time.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Interpreted**:  Scripting languages are usually **interpreted** rather than compiled. This means they are executed directly by an interpreter, which reads and runs the code line-by-line at runtime (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
2. **High-level**:  Scripting languages are usually high-level, meaning they are easier for humans to read and write, and they abstract away most of the complex machine-level details.
3. **Automation**:  They are often used for automating repetitive tasks, controlling web browsers, managing system processes, or interacting with APIs and databases. 
4. **Integration with Other Software**:  Scripting languages are commonly used for controlling or automating other applications (like a web page in JavaScript or a game engine in Lua).

### Examples of Scripting Languages:
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity to websites.
- **Python**: Used for tasks like web scraping, automation, and data analysis.
- **Ruby**: Often used in web development (e.g., Ruby on Rails). 
- **PHP**: Used for server-side web development.
- **Bash**: A Unix shell scripting language for automating command-line tasks.

### Comparison with Compiled Languages:
- **Scripting languages** are interpreted at runtime, making them typically slower but more flexible and easier to debug
- **Compiled languages** are translated into machine code ahead of time, often resulting in faster execution.
