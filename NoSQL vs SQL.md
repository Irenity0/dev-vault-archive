| **Feature**        | **SQL**                                              | **NoSQL**                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Structure** | Tables (Rows & Columns)                              | Flexible (Documents, Key-Value, Graph, etc.)     |
| **Schema**         | Fixed schema (structured data)                       | Schema-less or dynamic (unstructured data)       |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical (upgrading server)                          | Horizontal (distributed across servers)          |
| **Transactions**   | ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Varies (Eventual consistency)                    |
| **Query Language** | SQL (Structured Query Language)                      | Varies (e.g., MongoDB uses its own query system) |
| **Use Cases**      | Complex queries, relationships between data          | Large-scale, flexible data storage, fast access  |
| **Examples**       | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                            | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB               |
- **SQL** is for structured, relational data with predefined schema and complex queries.
    
- **NoSQL** is more flexible, scalable, and suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
