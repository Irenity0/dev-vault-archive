An **interpreter** is a program that **directly executes** instructions written in a programming language, without translating them into machine code all at once like a compiler. It reads and executes the code **line by line**.

Think of it as someone **reading a book aloud**, interpreting each sentence in real-time, rather than translating the entire book first and then reading it.

### Key Points:

- **No translation step** like a compiler.
    
- Executes code **line by line**, which can make it slower.
    
- Commonly used for languages like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.
    

In short, an interpreter takes your code, understands it, and runs it right away, rather than creating a separate machine code file first.
