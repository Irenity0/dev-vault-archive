**NoSQL** (Not Only SQL) refers to a type of database that does not use the traditional relational (SQL) model for storing data. Instead, it is designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data.

### Key Points:

- **Schema-less**: No fixed structure, allowing flexible data storage.
    
- **Scalable**: Can handle large amounts of data and traffic.
    
- **Types**: Includes document stores (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column stores (Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j).
    

### Example:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
    

NoSQL is ideal for applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and high performance.
