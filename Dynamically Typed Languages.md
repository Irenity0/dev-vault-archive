A **dynamically typed language** is a programming language where variable types are checked **at runtime** rather than at compile-time. This means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable—it can change as needed during execution.

### Key Features:

- *Type Checking at Runtime* → The interpreter determines variable types while running the code.
- *Flexible Data Types* → A variable can hold different types at different times (e.g., an `int` can become a `string`).
- *Easier to Write & Read* → No need to declare types explicitly.
- *More Prone to Errors* → Type-related bugs may only appear when the code runs.
