A **statically typed language** is a programming language where variable types are checked at **compile-time** rather than at runtime. This means you have to explicitly declare the type of a variable, and once assigned, the type cannot change.

## Key Features:

- _Type Checking at Compile-Time_ → Errors related to data types are caught before running the program. 
- _Fixed Data Types_ → Once a variable is assigned a type, it cannot change (e.g., an `int` cannot suddenly become a `string`).
- _Better Performance_ → Since types are known beforehand, the compiler can optimize the code better.
- _More Maintainable & Safer_ → Reduces chances of type-related bugs.

Examples: [[C]], [[C++]], [[Java]], [[TypeScript]], [[Rust]]
