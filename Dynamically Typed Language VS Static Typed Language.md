| Feature                | Statically Typed Language                          | Dynamically Typed Language                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| *[[Type Checking]]*    | Done at compile-time                               | done at runtime                                          |
| *Variable Declaration* | Requires explicit type declaration                 | no need to declare type                                  |
| *Type Safety*          | More type-safe, prevents unintended type errors    | Less type-safe, can lead to unexpected type-related bugs |
| *Performance*          | Faster & Optimized                                 | Slightly Slower, as types are determined at runtime      |
| *Flexibility*          | Less flexible, variables must maintain their type  | More flexible, variables can change their type           |
| *Error Detection*      | Errors are caught before execution                 | Errors may only appear when the code runs                |
| *Ease of Use*          | Requires more code but helps avoid mistakes        | Easier to write but can lead to hidden bugs              |
| *Examples*             | [[C]], [[C++]], [[Java]], [[Rust]], [[TypeScript]] | [[Python]], [[Javascript]], [[Ruby]], [[PHP]]    |
### Which One to Choose?

- Use _statically typed languages_ if you need 
	- performance, 
	- type safety, and 
	- maintainability (e.g., large applications, system programming).
    
- Use _dynamically typed languages_ if you need 
	- flexibility, 
	- quick prototyping, and 
	- ease of development (e.g., scripting, web development).
