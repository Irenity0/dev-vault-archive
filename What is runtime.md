**Runtime** refers to the period when a program is **running** or **executing** on a computer, after it has been launched and before it finishes. It is the phase where the program performs its tasks, processes data, and interacts with the user or other systems.

### Key Points:

1. **Runtime Environment**:  
    The environment in which the program runs, including the operating system, memory, libraries, and resources used by the program during its execution.
    
2. **Runtime Errors**:  
    Errors that occur while the program is running, as opposed to compile-time errors (which happen before the program starts running). For example, trying to divide by zero or accessing a non-existent file.
    
3. **Runtime vs Compile-time**:
    
    - **Compile-time**: When code is being compiled (before running the program).
        
    - **Runtime**: When the program is actually executing.
        

### Example:

- In JavaScript, the **runtime** would include the browser or Node.js environment where your code runs. When you use `setTimeout()` or manipulate the DOM, those actions happen during **runtime**.
    

In short, **runtime** is simply the **time** during which a program is actively running and performing its tasks.
