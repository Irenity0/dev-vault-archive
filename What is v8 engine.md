The **V8 engine** is a **JavaScript engine** developed by Google. It's responsible for executing JavaScript code in web browsers (like Google Chrome) and also in environments like **Node.js**.

### Key Features of the V8 Engine:

1. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation**:  
    V8 compiles JavaScript code directly into machine code (native code) instead of interpreting it, which makes the execution faster. It does this at runtime, so the code is optimized while the program runs.
    
2. **High Performance**:  
    Since V8 compiles JavaScript into machine code, it can execute JavaScript much faster than traditional interpreted languages. This is one reason why JavaScript runs quickly in browsers like Chrome.
    
3. **Garbage Collection**:  
    V8 handles memory management automatically by cleaning up unused data (objects) during runtime. This process is known as **garbage collection**.
    
4. **Cross-platform**:  
    The V8 engine works across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), which is why it powers multiple environments like Chrome and Node.js.
    

### Example:

When you open a web page, the browser (like Chrome) uses V8 to interpret and execute the JavaScript on that page, making the page interactive and dynamic.
