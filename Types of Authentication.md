1. **Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)**:
    - Only one factor (e.g., password) is used for identity verification.
    - Example: Logging in with just a username and password.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
    - Combines two factors for added security:
        - Something you _know_ (e.g., password).
        - Something you _have_ (e.g., OTP, smartphone).
    - Example: Login with a password and a code sent to your phone.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - Uses multiple layers of verification:
        - Something you _know_.
        - Something you _have_.
        - Something you _are_ (e.g., biometric data).
    - Example: Banking apps often use MFA.
4. **Passwordless Authentication**:
    - Eliminates passwords and uses other methods like email links, biometric scans, or hardware tokens.
5. **Biometric Authentication**:
    - Uses biological traits like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice patterns.
