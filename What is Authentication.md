Authentication is the process of verifying the indentity of a user, system or application to ensure that they are who they claim to be. It acts as a security measure to control access to sensitive data or systems.

### Importance of Authentication
1. **Prevents Unauthorized Access**: Protects sensitive systems and data.
2. **Enhances Security**: Reduces risks like data breaches or identity theft.
3. **User Accountability**: Tracks activity linked to verified users.
4. **Compliance**: Meets industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
