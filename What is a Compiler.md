A **compiler** is a program that **translates** source code written in a programming language (like Java or C++) into machine code or another language, so that a computer can understand and execute it.

Think of it like a **translator**. If you write code in one language (like English), the compiler converts it into a language (like Spanish) that the computer can understand and work with.

In short:

- **Source code (high-level language)** → **Compiler** → **Machine code (low-level language)**.
    

This process allows the computer to execute your program correctly.
