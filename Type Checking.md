Every programming language has a system of checking that values have been assigned their correct types, which is known as type checking. Type checking is essential in programming to minimize errors during the execution of programs. This usually occurs at either runtime or compile time. There are two categories of type checking implemented in most programming languages, static and dynamic:

[[Statically Typed Languages]]
[[Dynamically Typed Languages]]
